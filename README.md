# Stock Management System

This project aims to develop a stock management system that allows users to perform various operations such as calculating dividend yield, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, recording trades, and calculating volume-weighted stock price and GBCE All Share Index.

## Features

- **Dividend Yield Calculation:** Users can calculate the dividend yield for a given stock based on its type and current price.
- **P/E Ratio Calculation:** Users can calculate the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for a given stock based on its type and current price.
- **Trade Recording:** Users can record trades for a given stock, specifying the quantity, price, and whether it is a buy or sell trade.
- **Volume-weighted Stock Price:** Users can calculate the volume-weighted stock price based on trades within the last 15 minutes.
- **GBCE All Share Index:** Users can calculate the GBCE All Share Index using the geometric mean of prices for all valid stocks.
